# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can find the
full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in [our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## How to add a changeset

When you make changes that should be released, run:

```bash
npx changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select the type of change (major/minor/patch)
2. Write a summary of the change

The changeset will be added as a markdown file in this directory. When merged to main, the release workflow will automatically consume the changesets and create a release.
