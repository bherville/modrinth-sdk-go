# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the changesets repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## How to add a changeset

1. Run `npx changeset` in the root of the repository
2. Select the type of change (patch, minor, major)
3. Write a summary of the changes
4. Commit the generated changeset file

## Change types

- **patch**: Bug fixes, documentation updates, or other changes that don't affect the API
- **minor**: New features that are backwards compatible
- **major**: Breaking changes

When a PR is merged to main, the changesets action will:
1. Collect all changesets
2. Create/update a "Version Packages" PR with version bumps
3. When that PR is merged, it will create a git tag and GitHub release
